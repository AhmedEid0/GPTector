# GPTector: Detecting GPT-Generated Texts
GPTector is an advanced detection system designed to identify texts generated by chatbot models like GPT. While many systems rely on heavy pre-trained models which often excel in detecting longer passages but fall short for shorter ones, GPTector takes a different route. We prioritize lightweight, efficient models that are optimized for various lengths of text, ensuring fast and accurate detection across the board.

## Features:
### Feature Extraction:

Word Embeddings with word2vec: GPTector employs the word2vec model to convert words into numerical vectors. This dense representation captures the semantic relationship between words based on their co-occurrence patterns in large text corpora.
### Machine Learning Backbone:

Logistic Regression (LR): Primarily utilized for detecting GPT-generated content in longer passages, ensuring swift and accurate classification.

XGBoost: Specifically optimized for shorter text passages, this gradient boosting library ensures high detection accuracy.

## Docker Support:

GPTector includes Docker support, allowing users to easily containerize the application and ensure it runs consistently across different environments. To build the Docker image, use the following command:
`
docker build -t gptector/api-server -f Dockerfile .
`
Once built, you can run the Docker container and access the application on port 8000 by this command:
`
docker run -p 8000:8000 gptector/api-server
`
